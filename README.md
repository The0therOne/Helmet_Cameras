# Helmet Cameras
Mod adds helmet cameras for all players, then displays video (High Quality 1024x1024) on the second large monitor at ship. For now, it's the best mod for better CameraMan/ShipGuy/Operator experience for my opinion.

# Features
- Helmets cameras for 4 players. Later, it will support more players.
- Mod displays videos from helmet's cameras to second large monitor. It means, that security camera outside the ship is off. For my opinion, it is useless camera.
