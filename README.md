# Helmet Cameras
Mod adds helmet cameras for all players, then displays video (High Quality 1024x1024) on the second large monitor at ship. For better CameraMan/ShipGuy/Operator experience for my opinion.

# Features
- Helmets cameras for 4 players. Later, it will support more players
- Mod displays videos from helmet's cameras to second large monitor. It means, that security camera outside the ship is off. For my opinion, it is useless camera
- Support for 4 players
- High quality 1024x1024 video
- Synced video on monitor for all players
